Description: A refinement and rewrite of the original ANOM package by
    Philip Pallman.  This package allows full control and theming of
    ggplot-style plots of Analysis of Means graphs.  Analysis of Means
    (ANOM) is a powerful and intuitive method for comparing groups under
    the assumption that they share a common mean. Each group acquires its
    own, robust confidence intervals under that assumption, and it is
    visually intuitive whether the individual mean for that group is
    unexpectedly outside those intervals, or not.  A powerful alternative
    to flawed comparisons using e.g. league tables and arbitrary
    thresholds.
